<h2 style="color:red;">HEALTH HISTORY</h2>
<font face="ariel" size="5px" color="blue">
You’ll answer a few questions about your health history and places you’ve traveled, during a private and confidential interview.

<h1 style="color:red;">YOUR DONATION</h1>
<font face="ariel" size="5px" color="blue">
If you’re donating whole blood, we’ll cleanse an area on your arm and insert a brand new sterile needle for the blood draw. (This feels like a quick pinch and is over in seconds.)
Other types of donations, such as platelets, are made using an apheresis machine which will be connected to both arms.
A whole blood donation takes about 8-10 minutes, during which you’ll be seated comfortably or lying down.

<h1>REFRESHMENT AND RECOVERY</h1>
<p>After donating blood, you’ll have a snack and something to drink in the refreshment area.
You’ll leave after 10-15 minutes and continue your normal routine.
Enjoy the feeling of accomplishment knowing you are helping to save live</p>
