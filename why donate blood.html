 <p>A blood donation is truly an altruistic gift that an individual can give to others in need. In only 45-60 minutes, an eligible individual can donate one unit of blood that 
can be separated into four individual components 
that could help save multiple lives.</p><br>


 <p>There is a constant need for a regular supply of blood because it can be stored only
 for a limited period of time before use. Regular blood donation by a sufficient number
 of healthy people is needed to ensure that blood will always be available whenever and 
 wherever it is needed.</p><br>

 <p>Blood is the most precious gift that anyone can give to another 
 person – the gift of life. A decision to donate your blood can save a life, or even
 several if your blood is separated into its components – red cells, platelets and plasma
 – which can be used individually for patients with specific conditions.</p><br>

<p>Why is it Important to Donate Blood?
About 328 million people currently live in the U.S.
Each year, approximately 6.8 million people in the U.S donate blood. Annually, this adds up to about 13.6 million units of whole blood collected for donation in the U.S.
The Red Cross provides about 40% of our nation’s blood and blood cell components to donors.Your blood donations are used for patients in need of surgery, cancer treatment and transfusions for blood loss
 from traumatic injuries.</p><br>

<p>From one unit of blood, red blood cells can be extracted and used to treat patients who lost blood due to trauma or those who are recovering from surgery. Plasma, the liquid part of blood, is typically
 administered to patients with requiring treatment to
 improve blood clotting. Platelets, a third component, clot the blood when cuts or other open wounds occur, and are often used in the treatment of patients with cancer or those undergoing organ transplants. 
Finally, cryoprecipitated anti-hemophilic factor
 (AHF) is also used for clotting factors.</p>
